How has the different genre viewership changed over time?
What kind of data is available from the Steam API?

Data Sets to be Used:
Twitch API
Metacritic API
IGN API
Steam API

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
Make calls to Steam and Twitch API and see what kind of data is available
Figure out what kind of relevant data analysis can be made from available data
